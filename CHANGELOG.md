### Unreleased changes

## Version 2.3.4

- Improve performance of `Metric#to_s` (#152)
- Fix bug in escaping newlines for events with Datadog Backend (#153)
- **Breaking change:** Remove `StatsD::Instrument#duration`

## Version 2.3.3

- Capture measure and distribution metrics on exception and early return (#134)

NOTE: Now that exceptions are measured statistics may behave differently. An exception example:
```
StatsD.measure('myhttpcall') do
  my_http_object.invoke
end
```
Version 2.3.2 and below did not track metrics whenever a HTTP Timeout exception was raised.
2.3.3 and above will include those metrics which may increase the values included.

A return example:
```
StatsD.measure('myexpensivecalculation') do
  return if expensive_calculation_disabled?
  expensive_calculation
end
```
If `expensive_calculation_disabled?` is true 50% of the time version 2.3.2 will drop the
average metric considerably.
